#🌿 Organic Food Store Website

This project is a front-end only website template designed for an organic food store. It is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5, with an emphasis on creating a modern, clean, and responsive user interface.

The template showcases how a typical e-commerce homepage can be structured using only front-end technologies. It highlights important concepts in layout design, typography, color usage, and responsive behavior—all without any backend integration.

The project was created as a practice exercise in front-end development to strengthen skills in:

Writing clean and semantic HTML for better readability and maintainability.

Using CSS to create visually appealing sections with proper spacing, alignment, and responsive styling.

Leveraging Bootstrap 5 for its grid system, responsive utilities, and pre-styled components to speed up development and ensure mobile-first design.

This template serves as a static prototype, which can later be connected to a backend or CMS to make it fully functional. For now, it represents the look and feel of an organic food e-commerce landing page, including sections like promotional banners, product showcases, informational text, and a footer.
